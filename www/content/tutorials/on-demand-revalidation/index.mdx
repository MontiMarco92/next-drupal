[On-demand Revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#on-demand-revalidation) makes it easy to update your Next.js site when content on Drupal is created, updated or deleted.

Starting with `v1.6.0`, Next.js for Drupal supports On-demand Revalidation configurable per entity types.
